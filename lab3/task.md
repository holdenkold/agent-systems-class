### Homework 3.
This task is a "continuation" of the scenario that you programmed in Homework 2. So, we have a Customer, represented by the `ClientAgent` agent, who wants to order a table in a restaurant. This time, in the scenario, there are many restaurants that offer their services (they announce them in the `Directory Facilitator`; agent DF). It would be interesting if the restaurants advertised themselves as serving different types of cuisine (e.g. French, Polish, Spanish, Japanese). 

In the first step, `ClientAgent` asks the `DF agent` for a list of restaurants that serve dishes of the selected cuisine. If the restaurant with a selected cuisine is not available, they receive a negative answer. If such restaurants are available, then it receives (from `DF`) a list of restaurant `GatewayAgent` agents and sends to them `CallForProposals` for "Table booking, 2 people, date, time". Each GatewayAgent corresponds with accept, reject, not-understood randomly (or according to a rule invented by you). `GatewayAgent` can also ask `ManagerAgent` about the availability of a table (reusing the code from Homework 2). `ClientAgent` chooses the restaurant (randomly, or according to the rule invented by you) and the final stages of implementation of the `Call for Proposals` protocol follow - in accordance with its definition as the FIPA standard.
